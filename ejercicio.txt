We are a business company interested in following the price of cryptocurrencies. 

We want to create a website where you can initially see the weightedAvgPrice, volume and priceChange of different coins. 

We need a main view with all the coins we are interested in: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, ADAUSDT, LTCUSDT, AXSUSDT and BNBUSDT. In this page, we would like to:

BTCUSDT
ETHUSDT
ADAUSDT
LTCUSDT
BNBUSDT


Search the coins by name.
Order the coins (by weightedAvgPrice, volume, and most recently visited). 
Have the coin values updated every 10 seconds.
Have a button to manually refresh the values.

It's important to note that we would like to add more coins in the future.

When clicking a coin on the main view, we want to see a new page with more details of the selected coin, like: highPrice, lowPrice, openPrice, askPrice and bidPrice.

That's it. We are not interested right now in a fancy look and feel. An organized layout is enough.

Here's a resource we think it could be valuable for this task:
